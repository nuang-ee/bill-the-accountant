  CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
  2. Test the feature:
  @Bill can you analyze our bill splitting from yesterday? @friend1 @friend2
  3. Expected workflow:

  This implements the exact travel scenario you described - the bot can automatically detect that "User A paid for meals, User B booked hotel, User C booked flights" and create
   the appropriate debt proposals for each expense split! 🎉

  The system maintains the principle that debts are eliminated by amount (netting) rather than deleted, preserving full historical data as designed.
